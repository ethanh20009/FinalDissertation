Main modifications are made on following files:
```
dis/main.py
dis/main_live.py
dis/save_svg_composed.py
```

Once dependencies have been set up (Follow diffvg, Useg setup for creating the python environment), LayerVec can be run against a dataset using
`scripts/run.sh`

Some SVGs produced by LayerVec are stored in `composed_images`.
